# Free-README.md
This will generate a readme via your command line !


## Description 

This FREE README.md generator is intended to make it swifter for any individual to create their own readme.md by answering a few simple questions.

- With this application, I want users to save their time away from boilerplaters like a readme by quickly filling out some answers that will generate one for them.
- I built this to become more familiar with node.js as well as the inquirer npm.
- I learned that this is for me personally is pretty fun. Later, I have plans to upload a project inspired by our mini project to output an index.html page. I'd love to play around with the back end more.

## Installation

Right click on package.json file to select 'open integrated terminal' option. A terminal will open and you must type in npm i to download the files that will all inquirer to run. To invoke inquirer, simply type 'node index.js' and press enter. You will then answer a few questions for your readme to generate in the 'output' folder.
